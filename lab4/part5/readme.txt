    In what scenario does the check for null pointer in get_best_friend() become necessary?

        The check for null pointer becomes necessary when trying to access an object's pointer variable that hasn't been initialized.


    What would happen if the check was not there?

        If the check was not there, the program would return the address of an unknown memory location and potentially access unauthorized data.
